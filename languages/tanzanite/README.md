Tanznite is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, with strict type system and ruby-like syntax. Created as replacement for [Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)). <br>
Tanzanite is also highly portable due to nature of transpilation to high performant [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) code.
